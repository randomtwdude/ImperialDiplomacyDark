What you need:
- Inkscape (recommended version 1.4)

How to install the Dark Mode script:
1) Download and extract the 2 files "idb1-2-dark_mode.ini" and "idb1-2-dark_mode.py" from this repository.
2) Close the Inkscape program on your computer if it is running.
3) Navigate to the "extentions" directory of your local Inkscape installation. Should look like this `C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\inkscape\extensions`
4) Copy the 2 files "idb1-2-dark_mode.ini" and "idb1-2-dark_mode.py" into your Inkscape "extentions" directory. Approve any administrative confirmations to complete the copy.
5) Check the Dark Mode script is now installed correctly by launching Inkscape. In the upper toolbar, click "Extensions" and locate "Imperial Diplomacy" from the submenu. When you hover this, you should be able to select "Dark Mode B1.2".

How to use the Dark Mode script:
1) Obtain an SVG file of the Imperial Diplomacy B1.2 map from DiploGM (tip: use the "true" argument on the ".view_map" and ".adjudicate" commands to get the SVG).
2) Open the SVG in Inkscape.
3) In the upper toolbar, click "Extensions" and locate "Imperial Diplomacy" from the submenu. Hover this, then click "Dark Mode B1.2".
4) Allow the script some time to run. It may take up to 15 seconds. When it's finished you will see the map in beautiful Dark Mode!
